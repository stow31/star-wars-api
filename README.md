Website URL: https://starwarsapi_townsend.surge.sh/

Built using React and Star Wars API (https://swapi.dev/)

## Purpose

This was created as a coding test to call the Star Wars API returning the full movie list. 

## Features

- The home screen will provide a full list of the movies 
- Search the movie list
- Add and remove the movies from your favourites
- Favourites stored in local storage
- Click into each movie to see all information pulled from the SWAPI endpoint for an individual film

## Development Process

### Features To Add

- Use the other SWAPI end points to get further data on the moive
- When you hover over each individual character, show a tooltip containing further details on the user

### Painpoints

- Making the search not case sensitive
- Adding movies to the favourite list when the search results were rendered. The correct index value would not be parsed in to save the right movie as favourites
